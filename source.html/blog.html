   Due the rapid change in technology human lives are casually being taken over by technology. We can look around us. We can see many screens including the one which is being reading this on. Without having emails, videos, chats, messages, tablet, laptops, computers and other more innovation in every field, todayâ€™s world is incomplete. Technology and its aspects are being a part of daily life that makes life easier. technology is developing at a very fast pace and people from different fields of the world are making additions to it. It is impossible to ignore the impact of the techology in our lives, and nowadays more advanced and new technology has taken over us. Human resources has been decreased with the increase in the technology. Without doubt technology has left its marks in every field, including business,culture, economy, education and our life styles. We should be aware of the fact that how its effects on society are destructive or how they are advantageous. If we look around our surrounding are full of the technology even where it is hard to notice its existence. Most of the time we ignore the level of its importance and take it for granted. Technology has made our society so advanced that the children of two years are using mobiles, tabs and laptops and they are able to search their own favourite cartoon in the youtube. Older people who have read less in their time are also being good with the technology. They watch news on the phone, watch Tv on the phone and do their must of the task on the phone. Although in the present, people are facing a lot of problems related to teh economy, inflations, unemployment ,poverty, illiteracy etc but they are living in much better situations with comfortable communications and get themselves fed with a high flow of information. Technology has brought revolution in all the basic aspects of life.

   Role of  Technology in my part of life
   <br>
   <br>

i think the first thing that i have ever been introduced as a technology was mobile phones. During that time such advanced phone were not developed. People used to used phone with the keypads including my mom and dad. As a kid, I used to take my dad phone from the charging plot and play games on it. During that period that was bigger thing for me. Now I see kids of age two are playing with laptops and advanced phone when i was two i used to play with stones. Time has changed everything. Second thing that came to my life was computer. No wonder getting a computer was so much bigger thing in my society. Only one of my neighbour used to have computer that has box sized not LCD like today's. Seeing computer at my neighbour's house i used to feel jealous. And now we have three laptops two desktop and nobody cares. Some years later, desktop was just a box to everyone with the internet. Sensation of getting an internet connection at your home started. Getting an internet connection became more big deal for me than getting a desktop at home for the first time. So, yes finally internet connection was there. All day i used to hung up on my desktop surfing the thing that was not helpful for me but guess what age, everyone goes through that period. Facebook, yahoo, viber, Youtube was all i used to cared about and i am sure not only me as a child was like that. Even now i do lot of stuffs which is not helpful for me but now i can set the difference between how much to use and spend your time in front of screen. Texting a friend has been much more easire with the internet connection. You don't have to worry about anything about study whatever you search you get. Technology has changed my life so much in a good way as well as made me lazy as everything can be done online. You have to pay the bills of water, electricty, tax everything online. Wanna go for a movie, no need to walk just book the ticket from the home and enjoy the relaxation. Because of the technology, health of the people have been damaged. Eye problem, back problem, neck problem everything comes free with the technology. Most funny thing is that  though people have made different connection with the help of technology, there has been so much distance among the people. Many years back, friendship used to be real but now there are just technology between them. I personally have experienced that thing. People can be anything in back of the technology, which has brough destruction in our society. Scamming, cyber bully, cyber crime, Stealing, hacking has been easier with the help of technology. People with bad guidance get involved in so many bad crimes with the help of technology. Though it has changed our life it has also bough some bad virus into our life. Meeting and greeting with the freinds and family have been just a show these days as people are involved with their hand phones all the time. Technolgy has brought together everyone but at the same time it ahs created distance between people which they don't even realize. So, i believe technology has changed our life in good as well as bad way. Technology has made the world smaller. If technolgy was not there you would not have been reading this blog and i would have never expressed my opinion and experience on technolgy. See, life has changed be happy but don't forget the things around you. As i, myself is a technolgy student currently doing bachelor's in computing where i have to sit in front of laptop more than 12 hrs.
And may do job in a future where i have to sit in front of laptop for more than 12 hrs. So, nothing is easier as well as nothing is difficult at the same time in the world of technology.
